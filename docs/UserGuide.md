<h3 id="patient-in-processing" style="color: #088F8F">
  2. Registering patients and appointments
</h3>

There are three ways you can register new patients and schedule new appointments.

<b>1.</b> Use the `add` command to register a new patient.<br/>
<b>2.</b> Use the `addappt` command to schedule a new appointment for an existing patient.<br/>
<b>3.</b> Use the `add` command to register a new patient and schedule an appointment immediately.

<h4 id="add" style="color: #7393B3">
  2.1. Use the <code>add</code> command to register a new patient
</h4>

You can add new patients to our database with the `add` command. Each patient must minimally have a name and a phone number for administrative purposes.

Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG]` <br>
Example(s): `add n/Min Rei p/87654321`, `add n/Min Rei p/87654321 a/UTown`, `add n/Min Rei p/87654321 t/COVID`

- Parameters may be typed in any order.
- If you want to add multiple tags, please use multiple `[t/TAG]`.

<h4 id="addappt" style="color: #7393B3; margin-bottom: 0px">
  2.2. Use the <code>addappt</code> command to schedule a new appointment for an existing patient
</h4>
You can schedule appointments for existing patients using the `addappt` command.</p>

Format: `addappt PATIENT_INDEX d/DATE_TIME` <br>
Example(s): `add 1 d/today 3pm-4pm`, `add 1 d/16/10/2024 3pm-4pm`

- Adds an appointment to the patient at the specified `PATIENT_INDEX`.
- Examples of accepted `DATE_TIME`:
  - `24/03/2024 10am-2pm`
  - `24/03/2024 10AM-2PM`
  - `24/03/2024 10am - 2pm`
  - `today 10am-2pm` (this will create an appointment from 10am to 2pm with today's date)
  - `tdy 10am-2pm` (this will create an appointment from 10am to 2pm with today's date)

<box type="info" seamless>
  <b>Remark:</b> The <code>addappt</code> command allows the addition of appointments with a passed date/time. This functionality allows you to add an appointment for record purposes if you forget to add the appointment when the patient visits the clinic. 
</box>

<h4 id="add-with-appt" style="color: #7393B3">
  2.3. Use the <code>add</code> command to register a new patient and schedule an appointment immediately
</h4>

For walk-in appointments, you can also create a new contact and add an appointment with a single command. This command automatically creates an appointment linked to the patient which is being added.

Format: `add n/NAME p/PHONE_NUMBER [a/ADDRESS] [t/TAG] [d/DATE_TIME]` <br>
Example(s): `add 1 n/Boyd Anderson p/87654321 d/tdy 11am-12pm`

<box type="info" seamless>
  <b>Remark:</b> This <code>add</code> command is the same as the one above, but with an extra field (the `DATE_TIME`).
</box>

- Parameters may be typed in any order.
- If you want to add multiple tags, please use multiple `t/`.
- Appointments cannot end on a different day from when they start.
- If you try to add multiple appointments by using multiple `d/` in one single `add` command, only the appointment with the last specified `DATE_TIME` will be registered.
- Examples of accepted `DATE_TIME`:
  - `24/03/2024 10am-2pm`
  - `24/03/2024 10AM-2PM`
  - `24/03/2024 10am - 2pm`
  - `today 10am-2pm` (this will create an appointment from 10am to 2pm with today's date)
  - `tdy 10am-2pm` (this will create an appointment from 10am to 2pm with today's date)

## Known issues

1. **When using multiple screens**, if you move the application to a secondary screen, and later switch to using only the primary screen, the app will open off-screen. The remedy is to delete the `preferences.json` file created by the application before running the application again.

2. **Overlapping appointments between different patients** is allowed currently because we are working with the assumption that there are multiple doctors at the clinic to attend to different patients.

3. **Reset button** currently does not remove the focus on Patient and Appointment cards.
